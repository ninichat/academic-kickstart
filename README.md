Bear in mind this is a work in progress!

## Development

This is build using hugo. The simple theme that I very much like is academic.
Check it out [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/)!

You can also start a Hugo development server on your machine using the following
commands:

```
hugo server
```

Making it viewable on `localhost:1313`!
